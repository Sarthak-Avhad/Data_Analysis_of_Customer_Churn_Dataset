# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction using EDA, Feature Engineering & Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and predicting **customer churn** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Feature Engineering**, and **Logistic Regression**.  
The objective is to identify key factors that influence customer churn and build a predictive model to help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

## 🔹 Project Workflow

1. Load and understand the customer churn dataset  
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Distribution analysis  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Churn vs feature relationships  
3. Handle missing values and outliers  
4. Feature Engineering  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Scaling numerical features  
5. Train Logistic Regression model  
6. Evaluate model using:
   - Accuracy  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report
